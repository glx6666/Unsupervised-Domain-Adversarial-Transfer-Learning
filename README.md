## Objective and Purpose

This project demonstrates how to transfer labeled information from a **source domain** to an **unlabeled target domain** to improve target performance. It covers five representative UDA methods, with brief theoretical summaries and PyTorch-style reference code (educational skeletons suitable for small experiments):

* Deep Adaptation Networks (DAN) â€” Multi-Kernel Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MK-MMD) alignment.
* Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN) â€” Domain adversarial training via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL).
* Maximum Classifier Discrepancy (MCD) â€” Two classifiers maximize/minimize discrepancy on target samples.
* Joint Adaptation Networks (JAN) â€” Align joint distributions across multiple layers using Joint MMD (JMMD).
* Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT) â€” Teacher provides pseudo-labels and cluster centers for student alignment.
